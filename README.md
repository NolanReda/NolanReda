### About Me
___ 
Hello World! I'm Nolan, a full stack developer at the beginnging of my journey. I came into this through studying for a business degree where I was introduced to HTML and CSS, which ignited an interest in development that would lead me to LearningFuze to take the first steps to becoming an engineer. Since I have gained experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node, Express, and Postrges. I've already build a couple of projects which are on display here on my profile in both frontend using AJAX and full stack using React, Express, Node and Postgres and like I said, I'm just getting started.
